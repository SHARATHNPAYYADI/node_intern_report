\section{Conclusion}
In this project the UI frontend tool the Rosbag player has been created. The backend part of the product works on python libraries. The communication between fronend and backend has been achieved using websockets and rosbridge. 

During the course of project several issues has been solved. Some of the problem included the tackling of the messages from the topics in frontend tools.

Finally with this tool we can currently look at the metadata like topic list, duration of the rosbag. We can also handle playing of the rosbag like vary the speed, jump to the particular part of the rosbag using slider. We can also analyze the scans that are present on the rosbag. 

\section{Future scope}

This project can further be developed. One of the feature that can be included is the visualization of the map of the manufacturing unit. Also, plotting of the values coming on the ros-topics can definitely one of the interesting feature. 

Another feature that can be implemented like creating the issue on the JIRA board using the frontend tool whenever the error is detected.
